# Mini-game-in-Unity

This repository contains the implementation of an individual mini-project to develop a game in Unity.

## Description of the project

The game must have 5 levels:
<ul>
    <li>Level 1: Enter a room, push a button. The button opens a door. Enter level 2.</li>
    <li>Level 2: An enemy is moving in front of the second door. You have to launch missiles to destroy him. Then push the button. Enter level 3.</li>
    <li>Level 3: An enemy is chasing the user. The exit button is in a booth with an open door. Push the button. The door closes. Enter level 4.</li>
    <li>Level 4: The environment has holes. If the user falls down, he takes damage and dies. Get to the button. Push the button. Enter level 5.</li>
    <li>Level 5: The user arrives in front of swinging doors. He enters. There is no light but a light adjuster is shining. The light has to be switched on. When the light is full, an enemy with a life bar moves. You have to touch him several times. If you kill him, you win.</li>
</ul>

In addition, there has to be:
<ul>
    <li>A character (first or third person).</li>
    <li>The user has a life bar.</li>
    <li>Life tokens that heal the user when taken.</li>
    <li>Invincibility tokens that make the user invulnerable to enemies for 10 seconds.</li>
    <li>You must be able to quit the game at any time.</li>
    <li>You have to use the keyboard and mouse to move around, as well as to shoot.</li>
    <li>Enemies must change color when touched. The userâ€™s color also has to change when they take a token.</li>
    <li>Doors change color when they are activated.</li>
    <li>If the user loses, he can choose if he wants to play again or not.</li>
    <li>If the user wins, he is congratulated and then the game ends.</li>
    <li>You must be able to build the game in order to run an executable.</li>
</ul>

## More information about the implementation of the game
<ul>
    <li>Enemies have no weapons. They therefore attack only in hand-to-hand combat. The user can only attack by firing a weapon (when available).</li>
    <li>Ammunition is unlimited, and weapons do not require reloading.</li>
    <li>There is no crosshair, so you have to aim at the camera.</li>
</ul>

### Controls
<ul>
    <li>Move: Press Z/Q/S/D or the directional arrows.</li>
    <li>Run: Hold the SHIFT key.</li>
    <li>Jump: Press the SPACE key.</li>
    <li>Orient the camera: Orient the mouse.</li>
    <li>Interact/Shoot: Press the left mouse button.</li>
    <li>Menu: Press the ESCAPE key.</li>
</ul>

Note: The game is deliberately simple to finish. Have a good game!
